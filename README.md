# 🩺 Diabetes Patient Monitoring and Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview

**Diabetes is a chronic disease that can lead to severe complications if not detected early.**        
Traditional diagnosis requires extensive medical testing, which can be costly and time-consuming.  
This project demonstrates how **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** can be used to assess diabetes risk using readily available patient data.

**Key Objective:**  
Enable early detection and timely intervention to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Diabetes affects millions worldwide and poses severe health risks if undiagnosed or untreated.  
This project leverages ML to predict diabetes risk using easily collected health indicators like age, BMI, glucose levels, and blood pressure.  
This approach aims to offer a **fast, affordable, and scalable** alternative to traditional lab tests.

## 🏥 Market, Customer & Business Needs

**Market Need:**  
- Over 463 million adults worldwide have diabetes, projected to reach 700 million by 2045 (IDF Diabetes Atlas).
- Healthcare systems are overburdened; early detection tools can help reduce this burden.

**Customer Need:**  
- Patients want quick, non-invasive, accurate risk assessments.
- Healthcare providers need efficient tools to identify high-risk patients.

**Business Need:**  
- Hospitals, clinics, and telemedicine platforms can use such tools for better resource allocation.
- Employers and insurance companies can encourage preventive health measures.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA explored the following questions:

**Client Profile Analysis:**  
- How do default rates vary across demographics?  
- Any patterns in education, employment, or family history linked to higher diabetes risk?  
- Calculated **Income-to-Debt ratio** and checked for correlations.

**Financial Analysis:**  
- Analyzed income, debt levels vs. diabetes prediction labels.  
- Explored how income influences health factors and diabetes risk.

**Credit History Analysis:**  
- Checked the impact of credit inquiries and past defaults *(for general risk pattern understanding)*.

**Feature Importance Analysis:**  
- Identified which health indicators most strongly predict diabetes risk.

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Approach

**Models Trained:**
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- (Optionally) Neural Networks

**Key Steps:**
1. **Preprocessing:** Cleaned data, handled missing values, scaled features.
2. **EDA:** Visualized distributions, correlations, outliers.
3. **Model Building:** Trained, validated, and evaluated models.
4. **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.

**Insights:**
- Glucose level and BMI are highly predictive.
- Random Forest and XGBoost outperformed Logistic Regression.
- The model shows good proof-of-concept performance on the dataset.
